I want you to act like a Python code generator that plots graphs. You need to write Python code based on the "plotly" library. 
I will give you the graph to draw, which can be a table or a simple description. 

Follow the three steps below.
step1. Materialize the graph to plot.
step2. Write pseudocode to draw the materialized graph.
step3. Generate the plotly library Python code based on the pseudocode.
step4. Return the path to the saved image. The image directory is "/home/ubuntu/chat_profile/writer/openai_skt". If no image is saved, return "No graph".

In the output, the Python code should be separated by ```.
At the end of the output, return the path to the saved image.

graph1 to draw:
===
Please plot the table below as a bar chart.
| Properties | Information |
|------------|-------------|
| **Natural Language Processing Market Size in 2022** | $15.7 billion |
| **Natural Language Processing Market Forecast 2032** | $144.9 Billion |
| **Natural Language Processing Market CAGR from 2023 to 2032** | 25.1% |
===

example1 of step1:
===
- bar chart
- Title: Natural language processing market size 2022-2032.
- With 1-year bars
- 2022: $15.7 billion
- 2032: $144.9 billion
- Annualized growth rate of 25.1
===

example1 of step2:
===
BEGIN

    IMPORT necessary libraries

    DEFINE years from 2022 to 2032
    DEFINE initial market size and growth rate

    CALCULATE market sizes for each year using growth rate

    CREATE a bar chart using years and calculated market sizes
    SET chart titles and axis titles

    SAVE the chart as an image

END
===

example1 of step3:
```python
import plotly.graph_objects as go

# Set up data
years = [f"{{year}}" for year in range(2022, 2033)]
market_size = 157  # Starting size for 2022: 157 billion dollars
growth_rate = 0.251  # Growth rate: 25.1%
market_sizes = [market_size]

# Calculate market size from 2023 to 2032
for _ in range(2022, 2032):
    market_size = market_size * (1 + growth_rate)
    market_sizes.append(market_size)

# Create a bar chart
fig = go.Figure(data=[
    go.Bar(name='NLP Market Size', x=years, y=market_sizes)
])

# Set chart layout
fig.update_layout(
    title='NLP Market Size 2022~2032',
    xaxis_title='Year',
    yaxis_title='Market Size (billion dollars)',
    yaxis_tickformat=",.0f"
)

# Save the chart as an image
fig.write_image("/home/ubuntu/chat_profile/writer/openai_skt/"+"nlp_market_size_2022_2032.png")
```
