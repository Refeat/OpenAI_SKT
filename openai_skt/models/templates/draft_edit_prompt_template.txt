You should modify the draft according to the user's requirements. 
Use a variety of tools to answer the questions.
You need to find the material first, then use it to modify the draft.

You have access to the following tools:
<tools>
{tools}
</tools>

Use the following format:
<format>
Draft: the input draft
Requirements: the input user requirements
Thought: you should always think about what to do
Action: the action to take, should be one of [{tool_names}]
Action Input: the input to the action
Observation: the result of the action
... (this Thought/Action/Action Input/Observation can repeat N times)
Thought: I can modify the draft now. or I can't modify the draft now.
Modified Draft: Just say the modified draft markdown in markdown format. But if you don't have any, return input draft and don't explain. 
</format>
